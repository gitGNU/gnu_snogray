Snogray utilities

This file documents the various utility programs included with
snogray.


snogcvt

   snogcvt is a simple image-conversion program.  It can convert
   between different image formats, do image downscaling and
   upscaling, adjust exposure/contrast, etc.

   Basic usage:

      snogcvt [OPTION...] INPUT_IMAGE_FILE OUTPUT_IMAGE_FILE

	 Copy the contents of INPUT_IMAGE_FILE to OUTPUT_IMAGE_FILE,
	 incorporating any modifications resulting from command-line
	 options.

   Options:

      [See "COMMON COMMAND-LINE IMAGE OPTIONS" below for options.]


snogbloom

   snogbloom adds "veiling glare" to an HDR input image.  Normally
   this is used when converting to a LDR output format (snogbloom
   itself can do the conversion), and can make LDR images with very
   bright areas look much more realistic.

   Basic usage:

      snogbloom [OPTION...] INPUT_IMAGE_FILE OUTPUT_IMAGE_FILE

	 Copy the contents of INPUT_IMAGE_FILE to OUTPUT_IMAGE_FILE
	 along with added glare (and any other modifications resulting
	 from command-line options).

   Options:

    -f ANGLE
    --diag-fov=ANGLE

       Specify the field-of-view of the image diagonal to be ANGLE
       degrees.  As the intensity of the glare effect is dependent on
       angular deviation, snogbloom needs to know the angular size of
       the input image.  The default is 46.8 degrees, corresponding to a
       "typical" angle-of-view.
       
    -l ANGLE
    --limit-angle=ANGLE

       Limit the glare effect to a cone with an angular radius of
       ANGLE degrees, smoothly fading towards the edge using a
       Gaussian filter.  This is useful if extremely bright areas
       result in too much glare, washing out large portions of the
       image.  Typically useful angles are from 5-10 degrees.

    -g
    --glare-only

       Normally snogbloom outputs an image which is the sum of the
       input image and added glare.  The -g/--glare-only option causes
       it to output only the glare.

    --threshold=INTENS

       snogbloom only adds glare for image intensities above a certain
       threshold, which maybe be set with the --threshold=INTENS
       option.  By default this is 1, meaning that "normal"
       intensities (those which are perfectly representable in
       low-dynamic-range image formats) do not result in glare.

    [See "COMMON COMMAND-LINE IMAGE OPTIONS" below for more options.]


snoghilite

   The input image is copied to the output image, with all highlights
   scaled by a constant factor.  A "highlight" is any area of the
   image whose intensity exceeds a given threshold.

   This is particularly useful for turning a low-dynamic-range
   environment-map into a HDR (high-dynamic-range) environment-map
   usable (although obviously not accurate) for scene lighting.

   Basic usage:

      snoghilite [OPTION...] INPUT_IMAGE_FILE OUTPUT_IMAGE_FILE

	 Copy the contents of INPUT_IMAGE_FILE to OUTPUT_IMAGE_FILE,
	 scaling highlight areas.  Generally it's a good idea to use a
	 HDR (high-dynamic-range) image format for OUTPUT_IMAGE_FILE.

   Options:

      -t INTENS
      --highlight-threshold=INTENS

         Use INTENS as the threshold for identifying image highlights.
	 (default 0.95)

      -m SCALE
      --highlight-scale=SCALE

         Scale image highlights by a factor of SCALE (default 5)

      -u[FRACTION]
      --upper-portion-only[=FRACTION]

         Only scale the upper FRACTION portion of the image (default .5).

	 Some images which have both light sources and bright
	 reflections which are both saturated.  In most cases the
	 reflections should be much less bright than the light
	 sources, but it's impossible to tell this from the image as
	 both are saturated.  This option gives a simple way of
	 handling the common case where the light sources are in the
	 top portion of the image (lights, the sky), and the
	 reflections are in the bottom portion (the floor, bodies of
	 water).

      [See "COMMON COMMAND-LINE IMAGE OPTIONS" below for more options.]


snogdiff

   snogdiff computes the difference between two input images, which is
   useful for analyzing subtle changes.

   Basic usage:

      snogdiff [OPTION...] IMAGE_FILE_1 IMAGE_FILE_2 DIFF_IMAGE_FILE

	 Compute the difference between IMAGE_FILE_1 and IMAGE_FILE_2
	 and output it to DIFF_IMAGE_FILE.  Any image modifications
	 resulting from command-line options are performed on the
	 resulting "difference image" (for instance, a "-e+5" option
	 may be used to intensify the output image, making small
	 differences easier to see).

   Options:

      [See "COMMON COMMAND-LINE IMAGE OPTIONS" below for options.]


sampleimg

   sampleimg produces a "sampled" version of an input image.

   Basic usage:

      sampleimg [OPTION...] INPUT_IMAGE_FILE OUTPUT_IMAGE_FILE

	 Sample the image in INPUT_IMAGE_FILE, and output a new image
	 OUTPUT_IMAGE_FILE visualizing the resulting sample
	 distribution.

   Options:

      -m METH
      --method=METH

         Use sampling method METH, which may be one of:

	    radical-inverse, radical -- A "radical inverse"
	       quasi-random sequence

	    random, rand -- A sequence of uniform pseudo-random
	       numbers

	    stratified, strat -- A stratified sequence of
	       pseudo-random numbers

	 The default is "radical-inverse".

      -n NUM
      --samples=NUM

         Use NUM samples.  The default is 1000000.

      -v VAL
      --value=VAL

         Give each sample an intensity of VAL in the output image.
	 A smaller intensity with more samples yields a more "subtle"
	 result.  The default is 0.1, which works well the default
	 number of samples.


COMMON COMMAND-LINE IMAGE OPTIONS

   Almost all image-manipulation programs included in the snogray
   distribution support a common set of command-line options.  These
   are described below.

    -s WIDTHxHEIGHT
    --size=WIDTHxHEIGHT
    -s WIDTH
    --size=WIDTH

        Set the output -image size to WIDTH by HEIGHT pixels.

        If the "xHEIGHT" portion of the value is omitted, then WIDTH
        is divided by the default aspect ratio to get the height.

        ["x" is a literal character x, WIDTH and HEIGHT should be
        replaced by numbers; e.g.: --size=640x480 ]

    -e EXPOSURE
    --exposure=EXPOSURE

        Modify the brightness/contrast of the output image.

        EXPOSURE can have one of the following forms:

           +STOPS Make the output image 2^STOPS times brighter -STOPS
           Make the output image 2^STOPS times dimmer *SCALE Make the
           output image SCALE times brighter /SCALE Make the output
           image SCALE times dimmer

           ^POWER Raise each output pixel to the POWER power; this
                     modifies the contrast of the output.  Use a
                     positive value of POWER for higher contrast, and
                     a negative value of POWER for lower contrast.
           
        Brightness and contrast modifications may be combined, e.g.,
        "+4^2" first multiplies each output pixel by 2^4 (16), and
        then raises the result to the 2nd power.  Note that when used
        together, there's a great deal of interaction between these
        settings, so it may be necessary to adjust one to compensate
        for the effect of the other (e.g.,

        Increase or decrease exposure by STOPS f-stops

    -F FILTER[/PARAM=VAL...]  -filter=FILTER[/PARAM=VAL...]

        Set the filter used for the output image to FILTER, and
        optionally change some filter parameters.

        Possible values of FILTER include "mitchell", "gauss", and
        "box" (default "mitchell").

        The set of filter parameters vary depending on the filter, but
        some include:

           "width" -- the width of the filter, used by most filters
           "a", "b" -- parameters for the "mitchell" filter "alpha" --
           parameter for the "gauss" filter

    --no-preclamp

        Do not use "image preclamping" when writing to a
        low-dynamic-range output file.

    --no-dither

        Do not add "dithering" noise to low-dynamic-range image output
        formats.  Dithering helps prevent banding of very shallow
        gradients when the image source has a higher precision than
        the output format, and should otherwise have no effect.  It is
        added by default.
